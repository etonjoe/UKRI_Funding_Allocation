Demonstrating allocation of funds to HEPs 


## Introduction
Research England provides funding to English higher education providers (HEPs) for research and knowledge exchange with the mission to create and sustain the conditions for a healthy and dynamic research and knowledge exchange system in English HEPs.

They do this through providing performance-based, HEP-focused funding to:

- Deliver excellent research and high-performance knowledge exchange
- Unlock potential
- Generate economic and social impact
- Meet local and regional priorities and tackle national and global challenges.

This includes a strong focus on high-value, strategic and agile funding streams such as quality-related research (QR) funding underpinned by the Research Excellence Framework (REF) and support for knowledge exchange via Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF).
